# Smart Transit AI

# Team Name: Astro Coders

## Overview :
In an era where urban centres grapple with escalating congestion, unpredictable delays, and the pressing need for sustainable transit, Transforming Urban Mobility emerges as a pioneering endeavour to redefine public transportation. Crafted by Team Astro Coders, this sophisticated platform leverages the confluence of machine learning and real-time data analytics to deliver a seamless, efficient, and passenger-centric commuting experience. By addressing critical challenges—overcrowded buses, traffic bottlenecks, and environmental inefficiencies—this solution aspires to elevate urban mobility to new heights of reliability and elegance.

## Project Vision :
Our mission is to orchestrate a harmonious blend of cutting-edge technology and practical urban solutions. This project integrates an array of real-time data streams—traffic patterns, passenger demand, meteorological forecasts, and incident reports—into an intelligent system that not only predicts and mitigates disruptions but also optimises the operational cadence of public transport. The result is a transformative platform that empowers transit authorities with actionable insights and enhances the daily journey of commuters through precision and foresight.

## Key Features :

### 1) Traffic Prediction and Route Optimisation :

### 4) Weather-Informed Transportation Forecasting :
By incorporating meteorological data, the system anticipates weather-induced delays, such as those wrought by rain or snow. Proactive schedule adjustments and route recalibrations ensure resilience against nature’s caprices, safeguarding both passenger comfort and transit efficiency.This model trained,Performs with an Accuracy value: 1.00, Precision value: 1.00, Recall value: 1.00 and F1-Score: 1.00

### 5) Peak-Hour Bus Scheduling :
Leveraging historical trends and live updates, our solution dynamically calibrates bus schedules to align with fluctuating demand. Frequent services during peak hours curtail wait times and overcrowding, while scaled-back operations in quieter periods optimise resource allocation.This model trained,Performs with Train R² Score: 0.9998, Test R² Score: 0.9971, Train MAE: 0.09 and Test MAE: 0.31
